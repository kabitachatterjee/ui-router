# How to run the application?
- Download the contents of the repository ,start a local server to serve the page.(I used `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
- The application has code for demonstrating the scenarios listed in Angular Test.pdf using ui-router
- There is a hard-coded shopping list in my app controller.
- Each item is listed by name on the home page
- Clicking on each item takes us to the item details page    where it also gives us the quantity along with the name of each item.
- I have used ui-router and passed the parameters to the states to display corresponding templates.
